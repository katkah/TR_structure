## Overview

Telomerase RNA (TR) plays a dual role:

* It **serves as a template** for telomere DNA synthesis.
* It **acts as a scaffold** for the assembly of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex.

The **conformational state** of TR—either OPEN or CLOSED—is critical for regulating telomerase activity and its interactions with protein partners. The analysis in *Physcomitrium patens* sheds light on the structural dynamics that underpin these functions.
